        <p>
          Every year, millions of American taxpayers suffer 
          the consequences of not hiring a professional tax
           preparer. The personal effects of this decision are
            usually intense frustration, loss of productivity
             time or family time, and an irritable mood that can 
             last for days.

            means getting to know them a little better. Our confidential and
             non-judgmental services can assure you that we have your best interests
              in mind. We know that staying financially healthy is good for your

           of Changing Tax Laws When You Use
            Our Income Tax Services</h1>
        <p class=" service2-text">
          We know our tax system isn’t going
           anywhere—but that doesn’t mean it
            doesn’t change! There are changes
             to tax law at the federal, state,
              and local level every year. That
               means that the tax strategy that
                worked for you last year might not
                 work again this time around. Why 
                 miss out on new tax opportunities 
                 when we can help you navigate the
                  current laws to help you achieve 
                  the most optimal financial outcome.

          We love to rise to these unique challenges. 
          We love seeing the work we do positively affect
           the financial health of businesses, and touch 
           the lives of our colleagues and neighbors.
